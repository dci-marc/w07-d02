## Exercise 1: Basic Operations on ArrayList of Integers
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers and:
    - Add 10 elements to the list.
    - Remove the third element.
    - Replace the first element with a new value.
    - Print the list after each operation.
## Exercise 2: Working with ArrayList of Strings
1. Create an `ArrayList` of strings representing fruits.
    - Check if `"Apple"` is in the list using `.contains()`.
    - Find the index of `"Banana"` in the list using `.indexOf()`.
    - If the fruit is found, print its index; otherwise, print `"Not found"`.
## Exercise 3: Filtering Odd Numbers
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
    - Filter out all even numbers from the list (create a new list containing only odd numbers).
    - Print the new list of odd numbers.
    - BONUS: Remove the even numbers from the original array
## Exercise 4: Reversing an ArrayList
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
    - Reverse the elements of the list without using the `.reverse()` method.
    - Print the reversed list.
## Exercise 5: Summing Elements in an ArrayList
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
    - Find and print the sum of all the numbers in the list.
